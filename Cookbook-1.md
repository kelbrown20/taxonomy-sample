## Recipe Name: Bacalao ajoarriero

-The "ajoarriero" cod is probably the best known dish from the Navarre province in Spain.

<!-- image -->

## Ingredients : (For 2 people)

● 400g of desalted cod

● 1 spring onion

● ½ bell pepper

● 1 green pepper

● 1 glass of tomato sauce

● Salt

## Procedure:

● Wash the bell pepper and the green pepper and cut them into dices.

● Wash the spring onion and chop it into dices. Peel the cloves of garlic and chop them to your taste.

● Heat up 4 tablespoons of oil in a wide and low casserole, introduce the garlic cloves and, when they are brown, add the pepper and spring onion dices.

## Additional tips/Notes :

● Some people add potatoes to this recipe. If you want to try it, peel and cut the potato into pieces and add it at the same time as the vegetables. You will probably need a bit more time to cook the potato (15 - 25 minutes), but the final result will have a softer flavour.

● After the tomatoes are cooked, you can crack the eggs. You can either beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add them, or you can break them into the pan and mix them in the pan.

● Add salt and any spices you want and wait until the eggs are cooked. (Red pepper is highly suggested.)

## Keila Moral Figueroa

Recipe Name: Pulpo gallego (Galician-style octopus).

<!-- image -->

## Ingredients :

● 1 dash sweet Spanish paprika ("pimentón")

● Coarse salt

● 1/4 cup Spanish extra-virgin olive oil

● 4 large potatoes (Kennebec potatoes preferred)

● 1 octopus (2kg)

## Procedure:

● First of all: To soften the octopus, freeze the octopus first. Let defrost before cooking, then rinse it under cold water to clean.

● Fill a large pot with water and put it on the heat (don't add salt).

● When it starts to boil, we have to "scare" the octopus. This consists of taking the octopus by the head and dipping it in and out of the boiling water three times (about 5 seconds each time). This is done so that the skin does not come off during further cooking.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

● Put the octopus in the water and once it starts to boil again, we let it cook for about 30 - 35 minutes (you should prick it from time to time with a toothpick to see how it is developing).

● Once the cooking time is over, turn off the heat and let the octopus rest for another 15 minutes

● Transfer the octopus to a bowl and put the potatoes, well cleaned, with skin on and cut in half, in the same water. Let them cook for about 15 minutes (it will depend on the size, so again, it is a good idea to prick them with a toothpick from time to time to see if they are ready). In Galicia, they call this potatoes' preparation cachelos .

● Remove the skin from the potatoes, slice them and place them on the bottom of the plate.

● With kitchen scissors we cut the tentacles of the octopus in pieces of 1 centimeter, the part of the head in smaller pieces and we place them on the potatoes.

● Add coarse salt and sprinkle with sweet or spicy paprika to taste. Drizzle all the ingredients with extra virgin olive oil.

## Additional tips/Notes :

● Traditionally in Galicia a pine wood plate is used, since the wood absorbs the water but not the oil, professional pulpeiros (octopus cookers) recommend soaking the dish in the octopus cooking water before plating it, because in addition to providing added flavor, it keeps the dish warm during the meal.

● Although any type of quality extra virgin olive oil can be used, many professional pulpeiros suggest the Hojiblanca variety as the one that best suits this dish.

## Madhav Chithirasreemadam

Recipe Name: Dal Makhani

<!-- image -->

## Ingredients

● 200g urad dal, whole and unhulled

● 1 cinnamon stick (optional)

● 2 black cardamom pods (optional)

● 5 tbsp ghee or butter

● 2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped

● 20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated

● 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

● 2 green chillies, slit (or finely chopped, if you'd like your dal hotter)

● 1 tsp garam masala

● 1 tsp ground cumin

● 1 tsp ground coriander

● ½ tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder

● 75g tomato puree

● 150ml double cream

● 2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves

● Fresh coriander (optional)

## Procedure

Soak the dal overnight, then rinse well and drain. Cover with three times as much cold water and bring to a boil. Skim, then add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods, if using. Simmer until the beans are soft enough to crush easily against the side of the pan, topping up the water if necessary, because they should always be covered (this will probably take 45 minutes to an hour).

Meanwhile, melt four tablespoons of ghee in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then gently sweat the onions until soft and golden.

Stir in the ginger, garlic and green chillies, cook for another minute or so, then stir in all the dried spices apart from the fenugreek leaves, and cook, stirring, for a few minutes more.

Turn down the heat and stir in first the tomato puree and then, gradually, the cream and fenugreek. Turn off the heat.

When the dal is ready, drain it over a bowl, retaining the water, then roughly mash so some of the dal is squashed and some remains whole. Stir all the dal into the pan with the sauce, then, over a low heat, add just enough of the cooking water to bring it to your desired consistency - I like mine quite thick, rather than soup

## Additional tips

● Dal makhani can be had with plain rice, and a dollop of curd/yoghurt and maybe a little bit of Indian pickle. It is also enjoyed with a variety of Indian breads like Roti or Naan!

● I attach a youtube link for the same, as it would be much easier to follow along and it's cooked by a Michelin star Indian chef!

Last, but not least, the word makhani literally means butter, so don't go light on that!

## Muhammad Ibrahim Abdulhamid

## Recipe Name: Egyptian Koshari (Most Famous Traditional Egyptian Meal)

<!-- image -->

## Ingredients :

● 1 cup rice (long-grain)

● 1 cup lentils (brown or black)

● 1 cup chickpeas, cooked

● 2 tbs white vinegar

● ½ tsp ground cumin

● ½ tsp garlic powder

● 8 tbs olive oil

● 1½ cups onion, sliced

● 1 cup pasta (small macaroni or vermicelli broken into small pieces)

## ● FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE, YOU WILL NEED:

● 3 tbs olive oil

● ½ cup onion, finely chopped

● 4 garlic cloves, chopped

● 400g (14oz) tomato puree

● ¾ tsp ground cinnamon

● ½ tsp ground cumin

● ½ tsp salt

● ¼ tsp ground black pepper

● ¼ tsp chili flakes

## Instructions

## 1. Make the crispy onion topping:

● Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour.

● In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, but not burned (15-20 minutes).

## 2. Make the Tomato Sauce:

● In a saucepan, heat 1 tbsp cooking oil. Add the grated onion, cook on medium-high until the onion turns a translucent gold (do not brown). Now add the garlic, coriander, and red pepper flakes, if using, and saute briefly until fragrant (30-45 seconds more).

● Stir in tomato sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens (15 minutes or so).

● Stir in the distilled white vinegar, and turn the heat to low. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

## 3. Make the Koshari

● Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).

● Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 ½ inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.

● Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain.

● Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.

## 4. Put it All Together!

● To serve, fluff the rice and lentils with a fork and transfer to a serving platter. Top with the elbow pasta and ½ of the tomato sauce, then the chickpeas, and finally ½ of the crispy onions for garnish. Serve, passing the remaining sauce and crispy onions separately.
